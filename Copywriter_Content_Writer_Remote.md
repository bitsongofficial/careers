## How we work

We have team members working worldwide, from America, Europe to Asia.
We are trying to exploit the most effective working methods to develop/advance quickly and remain focused on goals and deadlines.

Communication is vital to us, and we rely heavily on Google Workspace, Telegram, GitHub and few others to help us stay in sync. All the technology we build is free and open source.

This role is a full-time remote position, and you’re free to work from anywhere. Be advised that most team meetings occur between 10am and 8pm CET Time. If you're applying from a location where these hours are outside your usual working hours, we expect you to adapt to our meeting times.

## What are we looking for:

We're looking for a versatile writer and strategist who can think big picture about strategic content to create and also go deep into the weeds of UX copy, ad copy, and email copy. Someone who relishes the idea of becoming the voice of the company, can think about how to employ content for SEO, and is interested in taking their writing to scale at one of the fastest growing crypto companies on the planet.

## What you will be doing:

- Lead the charge on content creation. You'll work with design, product, marketing, and leadership to codify and understand the unique tenets of our brand and help shape where it goes.
- Help maximize the impact of company announcements, product launches, and big moments. It takes a village to manage corporate and product communications so you'll be part of shaping and executing the strategy for big news, content releases, and community engagement.
- Manage internal and external content writers. Over time our content needs will increase so we'll need to build out internal and external capabilities to meet the demands of our growing business.
- Take initiative and be action-oriented. A global startup in a rapidly-evolving space can be frenetic, energizing, chaotic, ambiguous, and empowering. We need owners who are able to take initiative and be action-oriented.

## We're looking for someone that has:

- Proven record of excellent writing demonstrated in a professional portfolio
- Impeccable grasp of the English language, including idioms and current trends in slang and expressions
- Ability to work independently with little or no daily supervision
- Strong interpersonal skills and willingness to communicate with clients, colleagues, and management
- Ability to work on multiple projects with different objectives simultaneously
- Strict adherence to the style guides of each company and their policies for publication

### Also nice to have:

- Experience using cryptocurrencies, crypto wallets, decentralized exchanges, etc.
- Broad knowledge of blockchain technologies
- Capacity to be a project owner end-to-end. Put simply, you should feel ownership over content as though you are a steward of the brand — because you do. In a fast-paced environment you are expected to own problem areas and completely drive projects to completion.


## What we offer

- The opportunity to be part, as an early member of building the future of the Music Industry
- The opportunity to be a key player and build your career at a rapidly expanding, global technology company in an exciting, emerging industry.
